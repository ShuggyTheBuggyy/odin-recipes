        <li>Soak the cedar planks for at least 1 hour 
            in warm water. Soak longer if you have time.</li> 
        <li>In a shallow dish, stir together the vegetable
             oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, 
             green onions, ginger, and garlic. Place the 
             salmon fillets in the marinade and turn to 
             coat. Cover and marinate for at least 15 
             minutes, or up to one hour.</li>
             <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.
                Place the planks on the grate. The 
                boards are ready when they start to smoke
                and crackle just a little.</li>
                <li>Place the salmon fillets onto the 
                    planks and discard the marinade. 
                    Cover, and grill for about 20 minutes.
                     Fish is done when you can flake it 
                     with a fork. It will continue to cook
                    after you remove it from the grill.</li>
